# Blocks

---

## Why?

### Non-feedforward neural networks!

---

## So what does it do?

---

## Modelling

* Help construct Theano computation graph
* Annotate graph
* Easily access and filter variables

---

## Training

* Training progress serialization and resumption
* Per batch and validation set monitoring
* Dataset interfaces with (chained) iterators
* Live plotting

---

## Blocks ≠ Pylearn3

---

## Pylearn2 is a *“machine learning library”*

## Blocks is a *“Theano toolkit”*

---

## &lt;i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-5x"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

## Warning: Beta status

---

## In *Blocks* you build with *Bricks*

```python
class Linear(Initializable, Feedforward):
    ...
    def apply(self, input_):
        W, b = self.params
        output = tensor.dot(input_, W)
        if self.use_bias:
            output += b
        return output

x = tensor.matrix()
linear = Linear(input_dim=100, output_dim=50)
y = linear.apply(x)
```
